                 <p>Release date: Feb. 14<br>
                 Where to play: Mac, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series X<br>
                 much for the entire run of the series, Assassin’s Creed fans 
                 have had one request: a game set in feudal Japan. That game, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, 
                 is finally out in 2025, bringing literal years of clamoring to a close.  All told, Shadows
                  could be the biggest Assassin’s Creed in years or the biggest flop. Either way, one to watch!<br>

                 <p>Release date: March 6<br>
                 Where to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series<br>
                        
                 This fast-paced, colorful shooter is set for release in March. 
                 Traditional hero shooter mechanics are bolstered by power-up cards, 
                 which grant wild bonuses like a teeny-tiny noggin that’s tough to headshot,
                 or an upside-down world. This free-to-play game has super short rounds and rewards 
                 aggressive play, quick reflexes, and clever use of hero powers and shard cards.<br>-Cass Marshall-

                <p>Where to play: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series<br>
                  
                 Do we even have to remind you that Grand Theft Auto 6 is currently slated for 2025? 
                 Though there’s no announced release date, publisher Take-Two Interactive has the game set for fall 2025. 
                 GTA 6 is easily the most anticipated game expected out in the next year. While those games were set in the 1980s, GTA 6 brings 
                 Vice City to the present, following a Bonnie and Clyde-esque duo.<br>-Nicole Carpenter-

                We don’t know much about this upcoming multiplayer, co-op Elden Ring spinoff game, 
                but we know enough to be intrigued; the project brings roguelike and battle royale 
                elements to the punishing world of the Lands Between, as well as randomized. It all sounds very different from Elden Ring, 
                and yet it will probably have some ineffable Elden Ring-ness to it when it arrives sometime in 2025.<br>

                <p>Release date: 2025<br>
                 Where to play: Windows PC<br>Xbox Series X<br>
                
                 The first installment in the long-running series since 2012, this upcoming game is called 
                 simply Fable and, for several years since its announcement in 2020, details about it have been
                 scant. Former entries in the action role-playing series were all about player choice. This game
                 is nominally coming out in 2025, so here’s hoping we’ll hear more about 
                 what those choices might be.<br>-Maddy Myers-

                Even after a year of extraordinary RPGs in 2024, we’re still ready 
                for what could be another banger — or at least something stunning to look upon 
                — in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, a turn-based single-player fantasy RPG that’s 
                also the first-ever project from developer Sandfall Interactive.The French studio’s 
                game takes inspiration from Final Fantasy and Persona.<br>-Maddy Myers-

                 shooter is one to watch.The latest, Sniper Elite: Resistance, will bring the 
                 series. You’ll explore the world of Amasia 
                 alongside your AI partner in search of rare resources, taking 
                 on strange creatures and other players in the process.<br>

                    With Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, developer Warhorse Studios 
                    plans to deliver on the fantasy of role-playing a 15th-century 
                    Bohemian warrior with the reality of a life simulation.The original Kingdom Come: 
                    Deliverance is a fan-favorite smash hit, and the sequel looks to go even bigger.<br>
